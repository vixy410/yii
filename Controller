Controller Docs

The code created by Giiâ€™s scaffolding tool defines these methods for you:

  actionCreate(), for creating new model records
  actionIndex(), for listing every model record
  actionView(), for listing a single model record
  actionUpdate(), for updating a single model record
  actionDelete(), for deleting a single model record
  actionAdmin(), for showing every model record in a format designed for administrators
  
The generated code defines a few other methods:

  filters()
  accessRules()
  loadModel()
  performAjaxValidation()
  
  
Render a view-----
  public function actionCreate() {
    $model = new Page;
    $this->render('create',array('model'=>$model));
  }
  
The render() method takes an optional third argument, which is a Boolean indicating if the rendered result should be 
returned to the controller instead of sent to
the Web browser. This would be useful if you wanted to render the page and then
send the output in an email or write it to a text file on the server (to act as a cached
version):

   $body = $this->render('email', 'data' => $data, true);
